Codebook

This data is all a subset of the UCI HAR Dataset. 

The list of columns is as follows:

All data had to be pulled from one of 6 data sets: and X set of test and train data which was the number coded data, a Y set of test and train data with headers for each column, and a test and train subject identifier data set.

activity - Text identification of what activity is being summarized. Each activity text identifier had to be decoded from the numeric encoding on in the X data set.
subjectID - Number code for the subject in question

The following are all averages of the activity/subject pair data for that subject pair. Each number had to be converted to a number then, grouped then averaged. Feature names have been altered slightly. I expanded the t and f notes to their full Time and Frequency. I also removed the "()" as they were special characters that cause problems for some analysis.
